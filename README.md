Linear-Regression-Bike-Sharing-Assignment

You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the 
management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the
business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way
for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
